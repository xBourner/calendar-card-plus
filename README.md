# Overview

A **Calendar Card Plus** for Home Assistant Dashboards

I really liked the look of the calendar widget in Apple Car Play so i made a card that looks like it.

### How it works
 - 🤖 **Auto generating card** - Shows all calendars at once instead of only one calendar by default.
 - 📑 **Popup View** - Entities will render as Tile Cards in a new view
 - 🧠 **GUI Editor** - No code or scripts needed
 - 🔧 **Highly customizable** - almost everything customizable
 - 📱 **Optimized for desktop and phones**
 - 🌍 **Available in all HA languages**
